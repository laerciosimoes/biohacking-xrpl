                The Biohacking can consolidate data from your devices, health records, and apps you use so you can have a more comprehensive view of your health information in one convenient place. You are in control over which data is stored in the Biohacking and which data is shared with third-party apps and people you trust.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold items-center mb-4">Share Health Data with Third-Party Apps</h3>
            <p>
                You can choose to share your Biohacking data with third-party apps you trust. Apps must request the ability to read data from or write data to your Biohacking. All third-party apps must explain why they are requesting access to your Biohacking data. Each app is also required to have a privacy policy that describes its use of health data, so you should review these policies before providing apps with access to your health data. You have control over the data that you share with these third-party apps and can change what you share at any time. You can view at any time which third-party apps you have granted access to your Biohacking data and manage what data you share with and receive from these third-party apps. Some Biohacking data types may not be accessible to third-party apps.
