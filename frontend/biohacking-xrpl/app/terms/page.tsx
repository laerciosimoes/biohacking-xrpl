                <strong>Software.</strong> Our Services may allow you to download software, such as mobile applications, which may update automatically to ensure you&apos;re using the latest version. Our software may include open source software that is governed by its own licenses that we&apos;ve made available to you.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Corporate domains.</strong> If you create an account using an email address owned by an organization (for example, your employer), that account may be added to the organization&apos;s business account with us, in which case we will provide notice to you so that you can help facilitate the transfer of your account (unless your organization has already provided notice to you that it may monitor and control your account). Once your account is transferred, the organization&apos;s administrator will be able to control your account, including being able to access Content (defined below) and restrict or remove your access to the account.

            <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Third party Services.</strong> Our services may include third party software, products, or services, (“Third Party Services”) and some parts of our Services, like our browse feature, may include output from those services (“Third Party Output”). Third Party Services and Third Party Output are subject to their own terms, and we are not responsible for them.

            <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Your content.</strong> You may provide input to the Services (“Input”), and receive output from the Services based on the Input (“Output”). Input and Output are collectively “Content.” You are responsible for Content, including ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions needed to provide Input to our Services.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Ownership of content.</strong> As between you and Biohacking, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain your ownership rights in Input and (b) own the Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Similarity of content.</strong> Due to the nature of our Services and artificial intelligence generally, output may not be unique and other users may receive similar output from our Services. Our assignment above does not extend to other users&apos; output or any Third Party Output.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Our use of content.</strong> We may use Content to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services, comply with applicable law, enforce our terms and policies, and keep our Services safe.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Accuracy.</strong> Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may, in some situations, result in Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts.

                <li>You must not use any Output relating to a person for any purpose that could have a legal or material impact on that person, such as making credit, educational, employment, housing, insurance, legal, medical, or other important decisions about them.</li>
                <li>Our Services may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent Biohacking&apos;s views. If Output references any third party products or services, it doesn&apos;t mean the third party endorses or is affiliated with Biohacking.</li>
